Of course, they do a lot of blood tests and they weigh and measure you and probably probe into your medical records. Turns out, I was too fat for life insurance. On June 16, I weighed 340 pounds. I&amp;#8217;m 6&amp;#8216;2&amp;#8221; which means by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMI&lt;/span&gt; was 43.6 which put me well into morbidly obese&amp;nbsp;territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my being overweight, I found out during the life insurance tests that all of my blood levels were fine but one: liver enzymes. Turns out I had fatty liver syndrome from the large amount of belly fat I had been carrying around for more than a decade. Men are especially susceptible to this because we carry so much of our weight in our abdomen. This leads to fat being deposited inside the liver where it limits the liver&amp;#8217;s ability to do its&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people, I had long thought about getting more active and eating better. This life insurance problem was the push that I really needed. Turns out that it coincided with a positive shift in my spiritual and emotional life that started back in January of&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I write, I weigh 236 pounds and my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMI&lt;/span&gt; is around 30.4. I feel immeasurably better and can do things I thought impossible months ago. I exercise joyfully on a regular basis. I made it through the holidays eating all the wonderful treats my wife made and didn&amp;#8217;t gain weight. I&amp;#8217;ve learned a moderation and planning with regards to eating that I never knew before. So, how did that&amp;nbsp;happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking and&amp;nbsp;Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;m a nerd, I of course turned to technology to help me with my&amp;nbsp;goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started tracking my food with pictures and text on &lt;a href="http://aezell.tumblr.com/"&gt;a Tumblr blog&lt;/a&gt;. I was also documenting my workouts&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month after I started, a coworker suggested I try out the &lt;a href="http://www.loseit.com"&gt;LoseIt! site and app&lt;/a&gt;. That made all the difference. The iPhone app lets me search for calorie and nutrient content for lots of food and can scan barcodes for food purchased in a store. It can also track calories burned from lots of different kinds of&amp;nbsp;exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also purchased a &lt;a href="http://withings.com/en/wirelessscale"&gt;Withings scale&lt;/a&gt; which wirelessly sends my weight, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMI&lt;/span&gt;, and fat percentage to the LoseIt! app each time I step on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep myself accountable, I set up LoseIt! to update Facebook every time I worked out and whenever I weighed it would update with the amount gained or lost. Knowing that others can see your progress or lack thereof is a powerful motivator. There&amp;#8217;s also no discounting have friends and family cheer you&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoseIt! has tons of nice features. I especially appreciate the graphs and weekly email&amp;nbsp;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a graph of my weight loss for the last six months. It shows a nice drop and smoothing out over the last&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Weight Loss Graph" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0J2L2K2I350W371m3c1a/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-08%20at%202.22.32%20PM.png" title="Weight Loss Graph" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on removing fats and carbs from my diets. I dropped the fried foods, the bread, the sweets, the sugary drinks all of that. I focused on lean protein and vegetables as much as I&amp;nbsp;could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app started me out on a program with a certain calorie budget for each day. Exercise adds to the budget while food subtracts from that budget. My daily average of calorie intake for the last six months has been around 1200 calories. It has increased as I&amp;#8217;ve gotten more fit and exercised more and my metabolism has increased. The app does a pretty good job of letting you manage or manipulate the budget to fit your&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this lower caloric intake, I&amp;#8217;ve learned to listen to my body better. I now know when I am full and when I&amp;#8217;m actually hungry. I used to just eat as much as I had on my plate whenever it was time to eat. Now, I eat for fuel. I still enjoy treats and special meals from time to time. It&amp;#8217;s actually more special and enjoyable&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the percentage of my calories coming from fats (blue), carbohydrates (gold), and proteins (green). One thing to point out is that I try as much as possible to have the carbs be complex carbs and not things like refined sugar. Still, when the wife makes a homemade &amp;#8220;tres leches&amp;#8221; cake, I&amp;#8217;m going to eat&amp;nbsp;some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Macronutrients Graph" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3Q1o1S2C2F1b0w2W0H2j/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-08%20at%202.34.52%20PM.png" title="Macronutrients Graph" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool I&amp;#8217;ve used to get some good protein into my diet are protein or nutrition bars. I especially like the &amp;#8220;Pure Protein&amp;#8221; brand. These have carbs too, but they are limited and they can provide vitamins and minerals that might otherwise be lacking if you are limiting calories. Just be sure to read the labels carefully to be sure of what you are getting. Some protein bars are little better than candy&amp;nbsp;bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For workouts, I started with the elliptical and walking on a treadmill. I could only do about 12 minutes on the elliptical on its easiest setting and could only walk for about 20 minutes. But I kept doing&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a graph of my exercise calories by month for the last six months. Interestingly, I exercise more and harder now than I did in August, but I burn less calories. As you might imagine, moving a 340-pound body takes a lot more effort than moving a 240-pound body, so even a little less exercise back then meant more&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exercise Calories Graph" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/38210O2I3E2l2u2d3v1M/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-08%20at%202.26.02%20PM.png" title="Exercise Calories Graph" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached about 280 pounds, I felt fit enough to try running. Given my size and history of knee issues, I was worried about injury so I wanted some guidance and pacing. I chose the &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/mobile/c25k"&gt;Couch-to-5k app&lt;/a&gt; from Active.com. It walks you through 3 runs a week progressing in length and difficulty. Primarily, it uses interval training with walking interspersed with jogging. On about week 7 of the program. I had to backtrack a couple of times because I didn&amp;#8217;t feel ready to move on or went too long between&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself doing the elliptical about 3 or 4 times a week at the beginning. When I started adding in the running, it moved to 2 or 3 times a week with running being 2 or 3 times a week. I did occasionally mix in some light weights, but found I wasn&amp;#8217;t seeing much benefit because I wasn&amp;#8217;t doing it often&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Couch-to-5k app pushes me as it should and I do try to run a little farther and faster with each run. On the elliptical, I&amp;#8217;ve continually increased my speed and the resistance the machine uses, but I never really do it for more than 45 minutes at a time. In my research, working past that time frame has diminishing returns for weight loss. It can improve your performance or endurance but those weren&amp;#8217;t my goals starting&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to weights, I recently bought Mark Rippetoe&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738"&gt;Starting Strength&lt;/a&gt; and plan to start a strength program in addition to elliptical/running. It professes a simple program of barbell exercises to gain strength and mass. No fancy machines or crazy exercises. Just four or five movements with impeccable form. We&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t talk too much about finding the motivation for exercise. That differs for everyone. For me, the nudge provided by the life insurance debacle was enough to overcome a lifetime of being fat. It helps that I&amp;#8217;m vain enough to want to be able to wear normal clothes. You&amp;#8217;ll need to find that thing that gets you up at 4:30am in the cold and dark rain to get to the gym or to put on your running&amp;nbsp;shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached my goal of 100 pounds on Dec. 21 (appropriately, the supposed last day of Earth). Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve focused on maintaining my loss and pushing my exercise to new levels. Even through the holidays, through discipline and moderation, I saw no weight gain despite enjoying my fair share of cakes and sausage dips and the&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has become a new way of life for me. It&amp;#8217;s not a diet I&amp;#8217;m doing or a exercise plan. These things have just become a part of the way I&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of carefully tracking my caloric intake and macronutrient balance while continually pushing myself harder and farther with exercise, I&amp;#8217;ve been able to steadily decrease my weight, gain more energy, sleep better and wear clothes not bought in the big and tall section. As the saying goes, if I can do this, so can&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="health"></category><category term="weight loss"></category><category term="diet"></category><category term="exercise"></category></entry><entry><title>Handling time nicely with moment.js</title><link href="http://aezell.github.com//2012/10/22/javascript-momentjs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alex Ezell</name></author><id>tag:aezell.github.com,2012-10-22:/2012/10/22/javascript-momentjs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As every developer knows, handling timezones and the like is a real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PITA&lt;/span&gt;. The best minds of our generation have dashed themselves against the jagged rocks of Daylight Savings Time and that part of Indiana that&amp;#8217;s always 30 minutes behind the rest of&amp;nbsp;Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that detail isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily solved by &lt;a href="http://momentjs.com"&gt;moment.js&lt;/a&gt;, lots of other gnarly issues are. This library by Tim R. Wood makes working with dates in Javascript a real pleasure. I&amp;#8217;ll take just a moment to show you some of the hurdles we overcame with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our application, like all good developers are storing all dates in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;. Specifically, we are passing date strings in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; backend that will treat them as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;. Given that, the backend requires a specific format which is a variation of the typical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; date time &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; format you&amp;#8217;ve probably seen. All dates should be in the form: &lt;code&gt;2012-10-22 15:36:32&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to let our users provide us dates in whatever timezone their current browser uses. In our case, we&amp;#8217;re using a jQuery &lt;a href="http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/"&gt;time picker plugin&lt;/a&gt; by Trent Richardson. When our users are picking dates, we&amp;#8217;re telling the time picker to format them like this: &lt;code&gt;Oct 22, 2012 3:36 pm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we&amp;#8217;ll need to translate these times as we move back and forth from the data layer to the presentation layer. To translate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; string to user-local time, we simply do this (where &lt;code&gt;post_at&lt;/code&gt; is the string representation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; time from the data&amp;nbsp;layer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;post_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ss&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, what we&amp;#8217;re doing more specifically is creating a &lt;code&gt;moment&lt;/code&gt; object in &lt;code&gt;utc()&lt;/code&gt; mode. We are passing in the datetime string to parse into a Date() object and the format string of that datetime. We then translate the object to user-local time with &lt;code&gt;local()&lt;/code&gt; and then format into format we like for our time picker&amp;nbsp;plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going the other way around, we do the reverse essentially. This time, &lt;code&gt;post_at&lt;/code&gt; is the value from the time picker&amp;#8217;s input text&amp;nbsp;field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;post_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt; h:mm a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HH&lt;/span&gt;:mm:ss&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We first create a &lt;code&gt;moment&lt;/code&gt; object in local mode passing it our value and a format string. Switch modes to &lt;code&gt;utc()&lt;/code&gt; and then format for the data&amp;nbsp;layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally had about 20 lines of gnarly &lt;code&gt;Date()&lt;/code&gt; object manipulations to do the work of this two lines of code. Plus, I think my original code was&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;moment.js does lots of other nice things as well. Such as the&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to the&amp;nbsp;sublime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hours&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;humanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// a day&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s lots of other great features like relative time&amp;nbsp;output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fromNow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 4 years ago&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And for those of you coming from Python who love &lt;code&gt;timedelta&lt;/code&gt; objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 86400000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This library has made a difficult problem easy for us to solve. We&amp;#8217;ve been able to do the right thing for our users and for our database&amp;#8217;s sanity. I highly recommend everyone writing javascript applications to give it a&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="javascript"></category><category term="moment.js"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>Failing at Javascript MVC with Ember.js and Backbone.js</title><link href="http://aezell.github.com//2012/10/13/javascript-mvc-ember-backbone/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alex Ezell</name></author><id>tag:aezell.github.com,2012-10-13:/2012/10/13/javascript-mvc-ember-backbone/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently started work on an app using a third-party &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that deals with posting to and monitoring social networks. Given that the app was going to be a single-page affair and was strictly only going to be using this third-party &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, I thought it would be a good chance to dive into some Javascript &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick survey of my coworkers, all of whom are much more adept at Javascript than I, I decided to try Ember.js and Backbone.js. This blog serves to detail what I was trying to do and how much I failed at progress. While, as of this writing, I have a VanillaJS and jQuery based app that does exactly what I need it to do, I think my failures and roadblocks with Ember.js and Backbone.js might be&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me set out my goal, so you&amp;#8217;ll have some context to understand better why I did what I did and maybe even be able to see me going wrong as it&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we have a Django app and I was planning on dropping my Javascript &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; app into a content area with the rest of the page around it generated by the Javascript&amp;nbsp;application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary data source would be the third-party &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; mentioned above. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty straightforward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that speaks &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; and does it in a pretty consistent way. I had already written a Python wrapper around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, so I knew what to expect with my data access&amp;nbsp;methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page as concepted was a one-page app with mostly read views and only one action that would actually need to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and create new&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemed really simple. I also have a&amp;nbsp;deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The First&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Ember.js requires Handlebars.js and Backbone.js works really well with it, I had to figure out how to get my Handlebars templates into a Django&amp;nbsp;template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up finding &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/3886746"&gt;this template tag&lt;/a&gt; which let me wrap my Handlebars templates so that Django wouldn&amp;#8217;t try to evaluate anything inside of the&amp;nbsp;tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem&amp;nbsp;solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Experience with&amp;nbsp;Ember.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a good programmer should, I first started by reading &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/documentation/"&gt;the documentation for Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;. But, like a lot of documentation, it is dense and not terribly good at painting the big&amp;nbsp;picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was excited to find that they had a &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/"&gt;guides section&lt;/a&gt; but frustrated that those guides weren&amp;#8217;t exactly of the tutorial&amp;nbsp;type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I was pointed to &lt;a href="http://trek.github.com/"&gt;this essay by Trek Glowacki&lt;/a&gt; as a great resource for how to build an Ember.js app. And that it most certainly&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;#8217;s a step-by-step guide to build a massive app completely in Ember.js. It does not stop to answer questions about how these new concept might or might not match up with concepts with which the reader may be&amp;nbsp;familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, it&amp;#8217;s a tutorial that requires you to forget everything else you know. This is a great way to truly learn something new, but it&amp;#8217;s not so good for productivity under a&amp;nbsp;deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First&amp;nbsp;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the first code I wrote, I attempted to follow Trek&amp;#8217;s guide to the letter. I had outlets and routes and felt good about the structure I was laying out. However, it didn&amp;#8217;t really seem to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jsfiddle.net/veDjq/"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at what the code basically looked like at this&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; that corresponds to the Javascript in the link above is lost in time. However, the issue was that I was having problems with understanding how the outlets connected to the app and the notion that Trek&amp;#8217;s guides seems to assume that the whole page is controlled by the&amp;nbsp;Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was having issues with how the callbacks that are happening wouldn&amp;#8217;t be finished in time for the code that needed to use their&amp;nbsp;results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll remember the third-part &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; I talked about. It requires that a signature string be created and appended to every &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reopenClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;getSignature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        $&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ajax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;/auth/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I didn&amp;#8217;t know anything about promises or deferreds. This was one of the great things I learned when I asked &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12732692/forcing-ember-to-wait-for-value-from-an-ajax-request"&gt;this question on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. This is clearly not an Ember problem, but it was something great to&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized that the outlets and routes wouldn&amp;#8217;t work for me, mostly because it seemed like my simple app didn&amp;#8217;t need them. They were just clouding my already muddled understanding of what I was&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Second&amp;nbsp;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through some trials and tribulations, I eventually was able to cobble together some code that sort of worked. It seemed like I had a lot of verbose code that didn&amp;#8217;t do much except to get things set&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a heavy jQuery user, I kept thinking to myself that the functionality I had could essentially be done in about half the code if I just used jQuery. Sure, it might not have the structure I was searching for, but the question still&amp;nbsp;nagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jsfiddle.net/9aH2q/5/"&gt;This is the code as it stood and was sort of&amp;nbsp;working.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error that I had with this code was that The PostedPiblications data was always one action behind the PostedPubsCampaign selection. That is, if the app loaded with the data for campaign A, then the user changed the selection to campaign B, nothing would happen. I the user then selected campaign C, the PostedPublications shown on the page would belong to campaign&amp;nbsp;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see that the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; call was being made, but the page wasn&amp;#8217;t updating as expected. After fighting for this for a full day, I posted &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12785996/updating-ember-view-with-change-in-a-select-view"&gt;this StackOverflow question that remains unanswered&lt;/a&gt; with 40&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I had some code that worked moderately well, I still didn&amp;#8217;t really understand why I needed controllers and views. The models didn&amp;#8217;t seem to quite work the way my conception of models does (based on my experiences with Django and Sqlalchemy&amp;nbsp;models).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;Help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice that I posted a few question on StackOverflow while working through this Ember.js work. I was also in the #emberjs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; channel often and asking questions in there. Adding to that numerous Google searches and bugging my coworkers and I was quickly exhausting my supply of&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the relative newness of Ember.js and the current lack of experienced folks who have built apps with it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; are willing to help in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;, blog, answer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SO&lt;/span&gt; questions, etc., it&amp;#8217;s a challenging environment for a newbie. I did just stumble on &lt;a href="http://www.embernoob.com/"&gt;EmberNoob&lt;/a&gt; and that may grow into a nice&amp;nbsp;resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this trouble left me frustrated, confused and still staring at a looming&amp;nbsp;deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying out&amp;nbsp;Backbone.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, one of my coworkers made the point that we were already using &lt;a href="http://backbonejs.org/"&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; in many other places in our application. Now that I had a good sense of what I wanted to do in the app, it might be easier to learn Backbone instead of&amp;nbsp;Ember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took essentially a day and ported the code I had over the Backbone.js and ended up with &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/3886893"&gt;this bit of code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get past the point of a syntax error. JSLint wasn&amp;#8217;t helping and no one in the office could figure it out. It was at this point, with 4 days of Ember experimentation and 1 day of Backbone coding, that my deadline pressure started tickling the back of my brain and I had to move on to technologies I already&amp;nbsp;knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Temporary&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tenor of this post might lead you to believe that I don&amp;#8217;t like these two projects and think they aren&amp;#8217;t valuable. Quite the&amp;nbsp;contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these Javascript &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; frameworks have great promise for me and I intend to find another, perhaps better, situation in which I can learn and use them. I really appreciate the structure and modularity that both projects brought to my&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate that they forced me to think about my Javascript code in ways I previously hadn&amp;#8217;t had to. I like the idea of having the code that gets the data into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; be somewhat transparent to the code that pulls that data from its&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll come back around to both Ember.js and Backbone.js&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of this work, I learned a good deal about promises and deferreds. Additionally, I was exposed to the beauty that is &lt;a href="http://underscorejs.org/"&gt;Underscore.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://momentjs.com/"&gt;Moment.js&lt;/a&gt;. That progress alone was worth delving into this&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="javascript"></category><category term="mvc"></category><category term="ember.js"></category><category term="backbone.js"></category></entry><entry><title>Dependence and Independence</title><link href="http://aezell.github.com//2012/10/12/dependence-and-independence/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alex Ezell</name></author><id>tag:aezell.github.com,2012-10-12:/2012/10/12/dependence-and-independence/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was talking with some friends about the nature of dependence the other night. I made the comment that there was a point in my life where I probably didn&amp;#8217;t understand what it felt like to be completely dependent on another&amp;nbsp;person/thing/organization/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;#8217;m sitting on my couch as my son is sleeping. He&amp;#8217;s been sick today and is generally just feeling puny. I&amp;#8217;m looking at him now and thinking about this notion of dependence and how he is completely dependent on me. It&amp;#8217;s the basic core responsibility that every parent faces. Yet, to him, it&amp;#8217;s just the way things are. He doesn&amp;#8217;t know that there&amp;#8217;s a way to live where he doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be dependent on&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds like it should be something to strive for. That we should all strive to be independent. We are often encouraged to be this way in our school years. In fact, our son is at a Montessori school where independent work and thought is highly&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, there&amp;#8217;s an aspect of our lives where independence has few, if any, benefits. That&amp;#8217;s in the realm of the spiritual. That is, in the way we deal with other human beings and how we move through the world making contact with other people, it may well prove beneficial to rely on people. If one is so inclined, it may be even more solid to rely on one&amp;#8217;s definition of a higher&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son could almost certainly wake up right now and even though he&amp;#8217;s only 3 years old, go upstairs, wash his face and hands, change clothes, and eat a little something to see if he feels better. That would be a strong, independent series of actions. I would be proud of him for doing all those things without&amp;nbsp;assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to the times when he&amp;#8217;ll have to face real struggle small or large, like a friend being mean to him or a grandparent passing away, he&amp;#8217;ll need something more than a basic set of instructions or list of tasks. He&amp;#8217;ll need to rely on those around him that love him and if he so chooses in the future, his own definition of a higher&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found, in a relatively brief period of time, that my own independent spirit has been borne of dependence on close friends and my conception of a higher power. It seems that by shuffling off to those I rely on the small slights and perceived wrongs that the world foists on me each day, I am able to spend time and effort on the deeper, core challenges of being a kind, loving, tolerant person. That&amp;#8217;s got be a good place to spend my&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not to say that I unload all my crap on others and let them deal with it. It has become the sort of thing that deep friendships do best. I complain or grumble and my friend provides levity and objective perspectives that inevitably allow me to see a clearer path unclouded by my ego and self-serving instincts. In turn, I must do the same for them, or else I&amp;#8217;m simply back to the state I described in the opening. Sure, I&amp;#8217;d be dependent on someone, but if I can&amp;#8217;t be dependable then it all falls&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It nearly goes without saying that I am not in this enlightened state all of the time, or even a quarter of the time, but it&amp;#8217;s a state to which I strive and an effort I&amp;nbsp;enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="kids"></category><category term="responsibility"></category><category term="dependence"></category><category term="spirituality"></category></entry></feed>
